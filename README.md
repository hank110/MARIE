## MARIE (context-aware term mapping with string matching and embedding vectors)
- MARIE (context-aware term mapping with string matching and embedding vectors) is a tool to map a hospitalâ€™s unique terms to standardized clinical terminologies. 
- By incorporating both string matching methods and term embedding vectors generated by BioBERT, it utilizes both structural and contextual information to calculate similarity measures between source and target terms. 
- Compared to previous term mapping methods, our proposed method shows improved mapping accuracy. 
- Furthermore, as a general mapping method, it can be easily expanded to incorporate any string matching or term embedding methods.

### Warning
- This project does not provide BioBERT weights
- Please refer to https://github.com/dmis-lab/biobert and download BioBERT weights to save term embedding vectors as jsonl file

## Funding
- This research was supported by a grant of the Korea Health Technology R&D Project through the Korea Health Industry Development Institute (KHIDI), funded by the Ministry of Health & Welfare, South Korea (grant number: HI19C0572)
